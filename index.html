  <p><!-- Here Be Dragons, only some random ramblings ahead --><br>
    I need a propper portfolio site but just gonna dumping stuff here for now
    What about José Café?<br>
    Who knows.<br>

    It would be interesting to operate a food cart that basically turned an area into a café.<br>
    A "cup deposit" can ensure less literring.<br>
    Might as well just give real cups unless someone orders "takeout"<br>

    Content is king, might as well make content.<br>
